## Foto-Pics

https://github.com/Aimanski12/foto-pics

> I have always wanted to create a project that displays wonderful stock images and videos. But I wanted to make it in a full website and is also presentable and useful. So I decided to build this project to the next level. It is inspired by Pexels.com whose Web APIs are used to run this application.
